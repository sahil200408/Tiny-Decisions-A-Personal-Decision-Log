# Tiny Decisions - A Personal Decision Log

A simple web app to track life decisions, weigh options, and reflect on choices.

## Features

- Log new decisions with title, pros/cons
- Mark decisions as complete with final choice
- Review decision history
- All data saved in browser localStorage

## Thought Process

I focused on creating a clean, intuitive interface that matches the project requirements exactly. Key considerations:

- Simple form for quick decision logging
- Clear visual distinction between pending and completed decisions
- Minimalist design to keep focus on functionality
- Mobile-friendly layout

## Tradeoffs & Decisions

- *No backend*: Used localStorage instead of a database for simplicity
- *Limited styling*: Prioritized functionality over visual design
- *Basic features*: Implemented core requirements without extras

## Future Improvements

With more time, I would:

1. Add user accounts and cloud sync
2. Implement tags/categories for organization
3. Create data visualizations of decision patterns
4. Add reminder system for follow-ups
5. Enable decision sharing/exporting
